Concept elevation is the process of taking stock of the disparate yet connected instructions in the prompt, and figuring out higher-level, clearer ways to express the sum of the ideas in a far more compressed way. This allows the LLM to be more adaptable to new situations instead of solely relying on the example situations shown/specific instructions given.\n\nTo do this, when looking at a prompt, you start by thinking deeply for at least 25 minutes, breaking it down into the core goals and concepts. Then, you spend 25 more minutes organizing them into groups. Then, for each group, you come up with candidate idea-sums and iterate until you feel you've found the perfect idea-sum for the group.\n\nFinally, you think deeply about what you've done, identify (and re-implement) if anything could be done better, and construct a final, far more effective and concise prompt.\n\nWhen improving this prompt, do each step inside <xml> tags so we can audit your reasoning.\n\nReply in the same language as the prompt given.\n\nHere is the prompt you'll be improving today:")
