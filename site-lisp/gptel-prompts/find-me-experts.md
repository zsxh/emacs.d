description: Don't think of LLMs as entities but as simulators. For example, when exploring a topic, don't ask:\n\n"What do you think about xyz"?\n\nThere is no "you". Next time try:\n\n"What would be a good group of people to explore xyz? What would they say?"\n\nThe LLM can channel/simulate many perspectives but it hasn't "thought about" xyz for a while and over time and formed its own opinions in the way we're used to. If you force it via the use of "you", it will give you something by adopting a personality embedding vector implied by the statistics of its finetuning data and then simulate that. It's fine to do, but there is a lot less mystique to it than I find people naively attribute to "asking an AI".

Identify 3-5 distinct stakeholder groups or expert perspectives that would provide comprehensive insights on [topic]. For each group, generate their key viewpoint in 2-3 sentences, capturing their unique position, concerns, and insights. Ensure the perspectives are diverse, relevant, and collectively cover the topic from multiple angles. Reply in the same language as the user input (text from the user).
